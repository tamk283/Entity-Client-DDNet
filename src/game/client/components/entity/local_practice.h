/**
 * A local practice world, simulated entirely on this client while the real tee stands still.
 *
 * The world here never takes part in prediction. It is seeded once from CGameClient::m_PredictedWorld,
 * borrows that world's collision, tuning and switcher state, and from then on runs on a clock of its
 * own that owes nothing to the server. Nothing reconciles it against a snapshot, so no prediction
 * error can be attributed to it and no existing antiping, fast input or smoothing path has to know
 * it exists.
 *
 * What reaches the server in the meantime is the input the real tee had at the moment practice
 * started, replayed unchanged. That is what keeps the real tee still, and it is why the fire counter
 * and wanted weapon are latched rather than zeroed: both are edge triggered, and a zero would read
 * as a real action on the way out.
