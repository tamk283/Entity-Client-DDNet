 * component tick, see CFreezeZone::OnTick, CUnfreezeZone::OnTick and CCollidableZone::OnTick,
 * so without this every one of them costs a full round trip.
 *
 * It holds the ones the client has to act on, "QFr", "QUnFr" and "QStopa". "QHook" and "QUnHook"
 * are left to the server: they are solid geometry rather than something to act on, so predicting
 * them means teaching the whole collision about moving quads, and carrying the attachment state
 * that costs across every rebuild of the predicted world.
 *
 * They follow their position envelope, evaluated against the tick the server started
 * animating them at. FoxNet snaps that tick as GameInfo::m_RoundStartTick precisely so the
 * client can place the quads where the server had them, which makes them predictable.
 *
 * Quad layers of a minigame group belong to that minigame whatever they are named, so those
 * groups are skipped here the same way, see CZoneManager::OnMapLoad.
